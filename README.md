### Project Desciption
I am going to use the Chocolate Bar Rating dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings to answer 3 basic data questions:

* 1. Does higher cocoa percentage associated with higher rating?  
* 2. Which company location has the best chocolate rating?
* 3. Which types of cocoa beans produce the highest rating chocolate?
